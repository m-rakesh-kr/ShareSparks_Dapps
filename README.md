# ShareSparks
A semi-centralized social media platform

## Introduction:

- ShareSparks is a social media platform where users can register via MetaMask (crypto wallet) and can share their content.
- If users like some content they can engage with it by liking it or commenting on it. 
- The content owner would be rewarded with SparkCoins (crypto currency of ShareSparks) if their content receives the predetermined level of interaction from the audience.
- The core purpose of ShareSparks is to incentivize the content creators with SparkCoins, if their content is worthy and engaging.

## Overall description:
- ShareSparks is a platform where users can post their content, audience may interact with the already posted content as per their choice and the creators would get rewards as per their content engagement.
- The web-app will be semi-centralized, meaning that it will partially rely on the blockchain.
- The usersâ€™ identity, their content ownership, the transactions of rewarding them would be stored in a decenralized way on the blockchain, the content would be stored on IPFS (Inter Planetary File System) i.e. a distributed network and the rest of the data would be stored in a centralized database.
